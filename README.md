# WhiteRose

**WhiteRose** is an Android application designed to play a unique beep sound in the background at regular intervals—every minute or every five minutes. The beep used in this app is the original sound from the TV series *Mr. Robot*, providing an authentic experience for fans and users seeking a subtle notification.

## Features

- Plays an authentic *Mr. Robot* beep sound at customizable intervals (1 or 5 minutes).
- Runs in the background, ensuring you never miss a beep.
- Simple and intuitive interface.

## Important Note

> **Before using WhiteRose, please add the app to your device’s battery exception list.**  
> This step is necessary to prevent system battery optimization from interfering with the app’s background operation. Without this, Android may kill the background process, stopping the beep sound notifications.

## Usage

1. Install WhiteRose on your Android device.
2. Open the app and set your preferred beep interval.
3. Add WhiteRose to the battery exceptions to ensure uninterrupted background operation.
4. Enjoy the authentic *Mr. Robot* beep at your chosen intervals!
